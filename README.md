# Python for Programmers

I'm putting my learning pants on and doing a proper Python tutorial, instead of banging around like a maniac.

I'm up to here: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-for-programmers/articles/input-and-output

I'm putting inline comments when I learn something, and comments at the top of each file for when I'm looking back at what it taught me.
